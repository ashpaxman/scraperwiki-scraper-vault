<h2>UK Postcodes</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom">UK postcode system</a> 
is a very effective way for obtaining geodata from addresses and people 
(who usually know their own postcode).  
They are between six and eight characters long (including a single space separating the outward and inward parts of the code), 
of the regexp form "[A-Z][A-Z]?[0-9][A-Z0-9]? ?[0-9][A-Z][A-Z]"</p>

<p>Quick and dirty function to extract a postcode from an address field</p>
<code>def extract_gb_postcode(address):
    matches = re.findall(r'[A-Z][A-Z]?[0-9][A-Z0-9]? ?[0-9][ABDEFGHJLNPQRSTUWXYZ]{2}\b', string, re.IGNORECASE)
    return matches and matches[-1] or None
</code>

<p>The UK postcode database (and separate Northern Ireland database) was released under an open license in May 2010, 
as explained at <a href="http://www.freepostcodes.org.uk/">freepostcodes.org.uk</a>.  

<p>These two databases have been imported into ScraperWiki and can be accessed through the API:</p>
<code>http://scraperwikiviews.com/run/uk_postcode_lookup/?postcode=SW1A0AA
</code>

<p>This returns (in the case of a UK postcode):</p>
<code>{"Eastings": 530268, "Northings": 179545, "lat": 51.499840262348719, "lng": -0.12466267216331872, 
"Postcode": "SW1A0AA", "Country_code": "064", "Country": "England", "Positional_quality_indicator": 10, 
"NHS_regional_HA_code": "Y53", "Admin_district_code": "BK", "NHS_HA_code": 
"Q36", "Admin_county_code": "00", "Admin_ward_code": "GQ"}
</code>

<p>And from a Northern Ireland postcode:</p>
<code>{"Eastings": 234164, "Northings": 342061, "lat": 54.325965935510695, "lng": -7.4760857907459037, 
"Postcode": "BT945SY", "Country_code": "152", "Country": "N Ireland", "Active": 0}
</code>

<p>There will be other scrapers that can decode the admin districts where they exist.</p>

<p>For bulk fetching of postcodes it will be more efficient to attach to the database directly.</p>
<code>scraperwiki.sqlite.attach('uk_postcodes_from_codepoint')
lres = scraperwiki.sqlite.select('* from swdata where Postcode like ? limit 1', postcode)
print (lres and lres[0] or None)
</code>


<h2>OS Eastings and Northings</h2>

<p>Coordinate transforms (like text encoding) is hard for the same reasons:
The data looks ambiguous, and representations of one coordinate system point in 
another is not always faithful as it works with different shapes of the earth.</p>

<p>These functions are not currently available in Ruby or PHP as they are mathematically encoded.  
It might be possible to verify them properly, clean up the code and calculations, and 
then port them into the other languages.</p>
 
<p>It is possible to call them through a CGI, but as they are purely mathematical, there is a balance to be made.  
CGI calls can be very inefficient if done one per record on a large dataset, for want of 50 lines of self-contained 
mathematical code.</p>
 
<p>There should be something in between the full boot up, execute parameters, and shutdown of a script for a single call 
that is going to be made 10,000 times and importing a native library.  
I'm thinking it could be a long-running service, like that proposed for the dataproxy, 
that has the systems all loaded and ready.  This is where certain scripts stay running, waiting for the next call, 
in the UML for a request within the next 20 seconds.  This could make fast response possible.  
Maybe the whole of the UML in the controller could be based on Twisted.</p>

<p>The other option is to allow batch calls 
where we convert a list of 10,000 grid references or postcodes at once, though this 
puts the effort of optimization unfairly on the user.</p>

<p>What to do if you have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid">Ordnance Survey grid coordinates</a>?</p>

<p>Step 1: Convert from Eastings and Northings into OSGB36 datum</p>
<code>oscoord = turn_eastingnorthing_into_osgb36(easting, northing)</code>

<p>Step 2: Shift the datum to the more modern and widely used wgs84</p>
<code>altitude = 200
latlng = turn_osgb36_into_wgs84(oscoord[0], oscoord[1], height)
</code>

<p>In Ireland (including Northern Ireland) was mapped with a slightly different grid system, 
so can be converted with the following two functions:</p>
<code>oscoord = turn_eastingnorthing_into_osie36 (easting, northing)
latlng = turn_osie36_into_wgs84(oscoord[0], oscoord[1], 200)
</code>

<p>There is a helper function to do in one go, but not recommended as you lose control over 
the process and the height.</p>
<code>os_easting_northing_to_latlng(easting, northing, grid='GB')   # or 'IE'
</code>

<p>If you have grid coordinates, like 'TM114525' or 'TM1140052500', then these can be converted 
into Easting, Northing using:
<code>easting, northing = osgb_to_eastnorth(osgb_str)
</code>

<p>It might be worth verifying agreement between the two libraries
<code>osgb = "TM1140052500"
latlng1 = osgb_to_lonlat(osgb)
latlng2 = os_easting_northing_to_latlng(*osgb_to_eastnorth(osgb))
latlng1 ~= latlng2 ?
</code>

<p>There are functions for converting back from wgs84 and to grid coordinates, but they are 
not to be useful.</p>

<p>The source code for these functions is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ScraperWiki/scraperwiki/src/3dda4a362271/scraperlibs/scraperwiki/geo/">here</a>.
The geo_helper.py module is mentioned and linked from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/953701/which-gps-library-would-you-recommend-for-python">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is advised not to discard the original data fields and replace them with wgs84 in your records.  
If the data is in Eastings and Northings, leave it like that.  If you need wgs84, then ideally convert them
