Scraperwiki will not have access to your local files, unless you run a 
webserver on your computer. 

This isnÂ´t actually that hard to do with programs like PageKite 
(http://pagekite.net/) that allow you to have a (temporary if you 
like) webserver on your computer that servers files, without worrying 
about domain names, routers, ports or DNS. 

Even easier would be to put your csv files in a public dropbox 
(www.dropbox.com) folder. Files in the public dropbox folder have a 
url that you can use to access it. Here is a tutorial on that:
