puts "Portable Document Format (PDF) is an open standard for document exchange. The file format created by Adobe Systems in 1993 is  used for representing two-dimensional documents in a manner independent of the  application software, hardware, and operating system.[2] Each PDF  file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout 2D document that  includes the text, fonts, images, and 2D vector graphics which compose the documents.  Today, 3D drawings can be embedded in PDF documents with Acrobat 3D using U3D or PRC and various  other data formats.[3][4]
 In 1991 Adobe Systems  co-founder John Warnock  outlined a system called ""Camelot""[5] that evolved into  the Portable Document Format (PDF).
 Originally a proprietary format, PDF was officially  released as an open  standard on July 1, 2008, and published by the International  Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 32000-1:2008.[6][1] The ISO  32000-1 allows use of some specifications, which are not standardized (e.g.  Adobe XML Forms Architecture[7][8]).  ISO 32000-1 does not specify methods for validating the conformance of PDF files  or readers"
